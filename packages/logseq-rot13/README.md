logseq-rot13 adds a slash command (/ROT13) to logseq that rotates all alphabetic characters on the current page by 13 places in the alphabet. Doing /ROT13 again reveals the original text.

Why would you want to do this? My use case is a page full pf passwords to various systems. I don't want to make it too easy for other people to search my disk for usernames and passwords. So I ROT13 the page. It also prevents people shoulder-surfing information I don't want them to know.

ROT13 is not intended as a security protocol. It is far too easy to crack. It is intended to quickly obfuscate a page of information and just as quickly get the original text back.

As always, use it at your own risk.
